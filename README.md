# HexClock
First credit where credit is due. THis project was inspired by Mukesh Sankhla original project (See his video about it here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDJgYJqa-gg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDJgYJqa-gg)).
However I like doing things my way even if in this case meant redesigning everything from scratch (especially the 3d model which was way to thick)

The project is built around platformio and other libs, notably FastLED, NTPClient, TimeLib and the esp8266 arduino libs

I'm currently at the stage of implementing animations that I've created using the simulator.py file. This code is ugly  and shall not be discussed it's for creating simple animations
